# Hajj Hackathon
## PHLOW Project - TEAM G 031

### A project description 
PHLOW is an application that will control dynamically the Hadjjaj flow in the main zones of the hajj using electronic pass barrier gates.
So PHLOW is considered more as an information system. We have 4 main steps for our system:
### 1st: data collection
First we are going to divide the target area in zones ( camp zones, Arrival zones, Destination zones, waiting zones), then we place a line of strong barrier gates on the main access of every zone ( cost starting from 600$ to  1,000$ per barrier),finally those gates will automatically report to our system how many people are in each zone and their movement ( flow speed, zone size …)
#### 2nd: data storage; Using google cloud.
#### 3rd: data processing; 
Using the data that we have from our gates, we can implement an application that will dynamically calculate the suitable flow speed for each line of gates.
Also, once we have this data, we can apply some data mining algorithms ( prediction algorithms, classification algorithms …) and we can use Machine Learning process for this data too.
#### 4th: data usage
1- The application will automatically stop the gates in case of an overload in the zone ( some gates or all the gates)

2- The application will allow the controllers ( form Crowd Management Authority هيئة إدارة الحشود ) to open or close the gates manually.

3- Now we have the numbe#r of Hadjjaj in each zone, we can schedule automatically the exact time for leaving for each zone, and share it with them using public TVs or notifications via mobile,

4- With this data we can estimate how many people each target zone can support, so we can increase the Hadjjaj number by next hajj season.
